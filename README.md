# Basic Budget Calculator

### Background and Overview

Budgeting can be intimidating. One could use an already existing budgeting application service, such as Mint or You Need a Budget, but that would require an account creation, linking up one's banking account, etc. Another alternative would be to use a spreadsheet to keep log expenses, but spreadsheets and formulas can be intimidating to the average user.

This is where Basic Budget Calculator comes in - Basic Budget Calculator (or BBC) is, as the name implies, is a basic budget calculator.
